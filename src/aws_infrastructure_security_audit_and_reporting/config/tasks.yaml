map_aws_infrastructure_task:
  description: Conduct a broad, high-level scan and mapping of the AWS infrastructure.
    Document all discovered components with initial surface-level assessment of potential security concerns.
    Create an inventory of EC2 instances, S3 buckets, IAM configurations, RDS databases, VPCs, security groups,
    network ACLs, load balancers, Lambda functions, API Gateways, and other AWS services. Provide preliminary
    risk indicators for each resource type.
  expected_output: A wide-scope infrastructure map with initial security assessment indicators. Include basic
    resource inventory, preliminary security flags. Flag obvious security concerns for deeper analysis in subsequent tasks.

  agent: infrastructure_mapper

exploratory_security_analysis_task:
  description: Perform deep-dive security analysis of flagged resources and configurations. Leverage external
    threat intelligence, CVE databases, and security research to thoroughly analyze each identified risk.
    Research similar security incidents and their solutions from public AWS customer cases. Cross-reference
    findings with current AWS security bulletins, known exploit patterns, and emerging threats.
    Make sure to look up the docs in order to do a proper analysis.
  expected_output: A comprehensive security analysis with detailed technical evidence, external reference links,
    and thoroughly researched vulnerability context. Include references to similar cases, relevant CVEs,
    and documented exploit patterns. Provide detailed technical context for each security finding.

generate_report_task:
  description: Create an executive-level security report synthesizing all findings. Include an executive summary,
    detailed technical analysis, risk assessment matrix, and prioritized remediation roadmap, and instruction on how to remediate.
    Reference specific AWS documentation, AWS Security Blog posts, AWS re:Invent presentations, and official AWS whitepapers for
    all recommendations. Include direct links to relevant AWS documentation for each remediation step.
  expected_output: A comprehensive security report with clear sections for executive summary, technical findings,
    risk analysis, and detailed remediation plans and clear instructions on how to remediate.
    All recommendations must cite official AWS documentation sources, knowledge base articles, or AWS partner network resources.
    Include AWS-specific best practices and implementation patterns.
